# üß† Product Similarity with Vector Embeddings & K-Means Clustering

This project leverages the **OpenAI API** to create semantic **vector embeddings** of product descriptions and stores them in a **cloud-based vector database** using **SingleStore**. It then applies **K-Means Clustering** to identify and group similar products based on their semantic meaning.

---

## üìÅ Project Overview

**Objective**: To build a scalable system for discovering similar products using modern NLP techniques and unsupervised learning.

## üîç Key Features

- **Vector Embedding Generation**:
  - Used the **OpenAI Embedding API** to convert product descriptions into dense vector representations
  - Handled **batch processing** for embedding large volumes of product data efficiently

- **Cloud Vector Storage**:
  - Stored embeddings in a **SingleStore** cloud-native vector database
  - Enabled fast similarity search and clustering queries

- **Unsupervised Clustering**:
  - Applied **K-Means Clustering** on the stored vectors to discover **groups of semantically similar products**
  - Tuned the number of clusters using elbow method and silhouette analysis

- **Use Cases**:
  - Product recommendations
  - Catalog optimization
  - Similar item suggestions in e-commerce
